# simple dotfiles

## Overview

These dotfiles are designed differently to most. 

The strategy means your `~` directory is actually a git repo, and you ignore EVERYTHING EXCEPT the files you want git to manage. Checkout the `.gitingore` file for details. This strategy works extremely well for me, but might not suit everyone. Please investigate careful before choosing this approach for your own system.

For ruby, we do this:

* [chruby](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby)
* [ruby-install](https://github.com/postmodern/ruby-install)
