# simple dotfiles

## Overview

These dotfiles are designed differently to most. 

The strategy means your `~` directory is actually a git repo, and you ignore EVERYTHING EXCEPT the files you want git to manage. Checkout the `.gitingore` file for details. This strategy works extremely well for me, but might not suit everyone. Please investigate careful before choosing this approach for your own system.

## Contents

For the most part, I like to keep things as SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE. Some inspiration taken from here:

For ruby, we do this:

* [chruby](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby)
* [ruby-install](https://github.com/postmodern/ruby-install)

## Usage

I'm testing various strategies at the moment. Previously I have been working in master but now I maintain a local working branch called 'w' and submit PR's to master when I make changes.
